i6 Account
If you do not already have one, you will be assigned a Unix web server account at the start of the semester. This is called an “i6” account and we will use it to host our websites. All class work should be posted here. You are welcome to post projects elsewhere (i.e. your own domain) during the semester but be sure to also publish them to i6. Common questions about i6 accounts are answered on this FAQ page. If you forget your i6 password and would like to reset it, go to this page for instructions on how to do so.
