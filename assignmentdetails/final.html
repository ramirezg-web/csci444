        <h3 class="section">Drawing on the Web</h3>
				<p class="lead">Your final project will consist of three original, full-browser drawings and a custom interface to access them. You will incorporate multiple techniques for drawing on the web including vector and/or raster graphics, duration, interactivity, and data. The project has three parts to it: a project outline, the project itself, and a presentation. Optionally, you may choose to work in pairs.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section" id="outline">Outline</h4>
				<h5>Thought Process</h5>
				<p>Before you begin working on your final project, take some time to consider how you would like to approach it. What kind of experience do you want to elicit? How will the three drawings relate to each other aesthetically and/or conceptually? What kind of interactivity will there be and how will you achieve it?</p>
				<h5>Text and Prototype</h5>
				<p>Write a concise project outline of at least 200 words describing your intent. Consider the outline well; your final project should clearly emerge from what you describe in the text. Then, prototype a version of one of the drawings—with code, in the browser. This drawing can evolve with your project but represents the general direction of your work. If you will be working with a partner, you will need to write the outline and create the prototypal drawing collaboratively.</p>
				<h5>Submitting Your Outline</h5>
				<p>The project outline is due before class on Wednesday, April 20. Submit your text and prototype via NYU Brightspace to the “Final Project Outline” assignment. Copy and paste the text of your outline into the text box, upload the files of your first drawing, and include a link to your prototype on i6. If you work in pairs, you should both submit a copy of the outline via Brightspace and indicate your collaborator.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section" id="project">Project</h4>
				<h5>Three Drawings</h5>
				<p>The final project is an opportunity for you to develop a series of three original web drawings with the coding techniques we’ve been exploring all semester. These drawings are intended to be seen and experienced more than read; as such, they should should occupy the full browser window and you should keep HTML text to a minimum. Each of the drawings should include at least one raster or vector graphic that is rendered in the browser (such as SVG, the HTML canvas, or CSS shapes). Your drawings should include durational change in the form of CSS transitions/animation, JavaScript DOM animation, or canvas animation. And there should be some aspect of JavaScript-based user interactivity to the pages.</p>
				<h5>Navigational Interface</h5>
				<p>In addition to the three separate web pages for each drawing, create a fourth page that will serve as an interface to access them. You should be as thoughtful and creative in designing the interface as you are with the drawings themselves. The primary requirement for the interface is that it provide links to navigate to each of the three drawing pages. When the project is published, add a link from your Drawing on the Web assignments directory to the navigational interface.</p>
				<h5>Web API</h5>
				<p>Your navigation page should have an element of variability based on data drawn from a web API. Consider the relationship between your project and the API you work with as well as how its data is translated into the page. You’re welcome to work with the same API you explored in <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring22/CSCI-UA.0380-001/assignments/web-api/">the assignment</a>; <a href="https://i6.cims.nyu.edu/~jc3436/380/web-api/">this page includes other APIs</a> that the class researched. Your individual drawing pages do not require an API call as the navigational interface does.</p>
				<h5>State of Completion</h5>
				<p>By the time you present, your project should be fully complete. Your CSS and JavaScript should be linked to as external documents and the pages should be viewable in current versions of contemporary web browsers. As you finish your work, pay attention to presentational aspects of the site and the overall quality of its display. Although there are several required elements, your project does not need to be highly complex; it should, however, be polished. Moreover, the concept and code implementation must be original and unique to this project.</p><p>
				
				</p><h4 class="section" id="presentation">Presentation</h4>
				<p>You will be required to do a brief presentation of your work on Wednesday, May 4. This is a time for you to share your accomplishments and describe your process. Your presentation should be approximately 3 minutes in length and well-prepared. As with the project outline, the presentation is part of your grade. Consider how you will introduce, describe, and demo your work and also talk about its technical development.</p>

				<h4 class="section">Submitting Your Project</h4>
				<p>Publish your project on the i6 web server, update the link from your portfolio page, and submit the following via <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/">NYU Brightspace</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The URL to your project in the general form of: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/drawing/</li>
					<li>The URL to the web API used on your navigation page</li>
					<li>A compressed archive of your project files (including the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any media resources)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
