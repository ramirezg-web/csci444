        <h3 class="section">Web API</h3>
				<p class="lead">In this assignment you will research web APIs that may be useful in Drawing on the Web and sketch an example page with one of your findings. You may choose to work on this assignment with a partner.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Web API Research</h4>
        <p>Take some time to explore a few different platform APIs (other than those discussed in class) that make data freely available to coders. You may want to begin by considering a category of data to research—meteorological, anthropological, financial, astronomical, etc. Browse the documentation of the API, how it’s accessed, its terms of service, and what kind of data it supplies.</p>
        <p>Once you find an API that looks interesting and accessible to you, write a description of at least 100 words introducing the API to your classmates. Contextualize your introduction to the API within the Drawing on the Web curriculum and its creative orientation.</p>
        
        <h4 class="section">Drawing on the Web API</h4>
				<p>Next, you will design and code a new web page with the text you wrote about the web API. Include a link to the API within your text. The page should incorporate CSS layout and a web font of your choice using the <code>@font-face</code> rule.</p>
        <p>In addition to your introductory text and a link to the API, this page should include a live example of the platform API in use. The web page’s script should call the API and use one or more pieces of data to vary how the page is experienced. Rather than simply writing data to the page as text, use it to select a media element to display, vary durational change, update styles, or some other mapping of data to occurrence. Think of this as a sketch that you or another classmate could refer back to in the future.</p>

				<h4 class="section">Submitting Your Assignment</h4>
				<p>Publish the new web page to your i6 account, update the project link from your portfolio page, and submit the following via <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/">NYU Brightspace</a>.</p>
				<ul>
          <li>The text of your report and a link to the API pasted into the assignment text box.</li>
					<li>The URL to the new web page in the general form of: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/drawing/</li>
					<li>A compressed archive containing all the project files (code and media resources)</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Grading</h4>
				<p>This assignment is worth 10 points.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A description of at least 100 words introducing the web API (3 points)</li>
          <li>A new web page with the introductory text and link, CSS layout, and a web font (3 points)</li>
          <li>A live demo of the API that varies how the web page is experienced (4 points)</li>
				</ul>
