				<p class="lead">In this assignment, you will create an SVG icon system.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Vector Glyphs</h4>
				<p>You can think of an icon system as a set of categorically-related symbols designed with a consistent aesthetic. Begin by considering what category or theme you would like to design your icon system around. Once you decide, you may want to take some time to sketch out a few preliminary symbols that will guide your approach to the rest of them. Your icon system for the SVG assignment should consist of at least five original symbols.</p>
				<p>Using illustration software and a text editor, create a series of vector graphic symbols—each in its own document—that will comprise your icon system. When applied to a web page, your icon system will function similar to a text font. As such, you need not worry about the color of each symbol. Design each to be a two-dimensional, black glyph that will read well at variable sizes.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">SVG Code</h4>
				<p>Once you’ve completed the design of your icon system, make sure each symbol is simplified into a single, continuous shape with no outlines. Convert any paths into shapes and merge all shapes into their simplest form—you should be able to select the entire icon with one click in the illustration software. Then, export each individual project file in SVG format. This results in multiple, plain text documents of SVG code that can be viewed in a text editor.</p>
				<p>Using your text editor and/or the <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/">IcoMoon app</a>, create an SVG sprite by combining the essential code for each symbol into a single SVG document. Each individual icon should be enclosed in a <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> element with a unique <code>id</code> and consistent <code>viewBox</code> attributes. Each <code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> element should contain <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> tags. <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> serves as the descriptive text of each icon and <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> defines the vector shape.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Web Page</h4>
				<p>With your icon system coded into a single SVG document, you will incorporate the full palette of symbols into a new web page. Use the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element along with the <code>&lt;use&gt;</code> child element to display each symbol of your icon system. Use the <code>href</code> attribute to link to each symbol: <code>href="icons.svg#glyph"</code>, where <code>icons.svg</code> is the name of the file and <code>#glyph</code> is the <code>id</code> of a particular symbol in the file.</p>
				<p>Now, use CSS to style each each of the icons in your system. A good way to do this is to give the parent, <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element a <code>class</code> that can be referenced by your CSS selector. You should include <code>fill</code> (color), <code>width</code>, and <code>height</code> properties for all of your symbols. Lay out the icons so that they are uniformly visible across the browser window. Lastly, add additional design elements to the web page that are consistent with or give additional context to the theme of your icon system.</p>

				<h4 class="section">Submitting Your Assignment</h4>
				<p>Update the project link from your portfolio page and submit the following via <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/">NYU Brightspace</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The URL to your assignment in the general form of: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/drawing/</li>
					<li>A compressed archive containing all the files (SVG, HTML, CSS, and illustration software documents) of your project</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Grading</h4>
				<p>This assignment is worth 10 points.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>An original icon system of at least five vector symbols that are categorically and aesthetically related (5 points)</li>
					<li>A single SVG document that contains the code for the full icon system (2 points)</li>
					<li>A web page that displays each symbol of the icon system together (1 point)</li>
					<li>CSS for the color and size of each symbol, displayed uniformly across the page. (1 point)</li>
          <li>Additional page design elements consistent with the theme of the icon system (1 point)</li>
				</ul>
