        <h3 class="section">CSS Transforms and Animation</h3>
				<p class="lead">In this assignment, you will use CSS transforms to make a three-dimensional drawing and CSS animation to set it in motion.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Drawing</h4>
				<p>Using shapes coded with CSS or SVG, create a three-dimensional drawing (other than a cube) of an abstract or representational form. Your drawing should employ CSS transforms with 3D perspective to create at least six shapes that exist on the X, Y, and Z axes. Taken together, these shapes can create an abstract polyhedron or a representational form such as a bird, tree, flower, or building. The drawing should be created exclusively with HTML, CSS, and SVG and, as usual, must be designed and coded by you.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Animation</h4>
				<p>Once you’ve completed the drawing, animate it using the CSS <code>@keyframes</code> rule. You may choose to animate the entire drawing or isolated aspects of it. You might also animate multiple copies of your original drawing to create a more scenic effect in the browser window. Finally, add a CSS transition in response to a user gesture such as the <code>:hover</code> or <code>:active</code> peudoclasses.</p>
        <p>Beyond these requirements, feel free to add additional CSS and/or raster graphics to complete your drawing.</p>

				<h4 class="section">Submitting Your Assignment</h4>
				<p>Update the project link from your portfolio page and submit the following via <a href="https://brightspace.nyu.edu/">NYU Brightspace</a>.</p>
				<ul>

					<li>A compressed archive of your project files (including the HTML, CSS, SVG, and any image resources)</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
