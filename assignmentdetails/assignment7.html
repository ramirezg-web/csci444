				<p class="lead">In this assignment, you will create a dual-layer drawing consisting of a two-dimensional background canvas and a three-dimensional foreground canvas.</p>
				
<!-- 				custom 3D geometry to a web page using WebGL with the three.js JavaScript library. -->
				
				<h4 class="section">Background Layer</h4>
				<p>The background layer of your drawing should consist of an HTML canvas with a 2D rendering context. The canvas should occupy the full width and height of the browser window, updated accordingly if the browser is resized. Continue to explore drawing techniques from recent weeks in your 2D canvas script, being sensitive to how processor-intensive it is; your background layer can be animated but this is not required. Because this is the background of your drawing, it should set the context for whatever you do in the foreground layer.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Foreground Layer</h4>
				<p>Using <a href="http://threejs.org/">three.js</a>, create a WebGL scene that animates 3D geometry in the foreground layer of your drawing. The object you create should be more complex than one of the three.js shape primitives. As such, you may choose to create your mesh with 3D graphics software, such as <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> or the <a href="https://threejs.org/editor/">three.js editor</a>. It’s also possible to create more complex forms by combining shape primitives in three.js. A third option is to adapt from an existing 2D image or 3D model. The foreground layer should include at least one 3D model, material, lighting, and animation.</p>

				<h4 class="section">Submitting Your Assignment</h4>
				<p>Update the project link from your portfolio page and submit the following via <a href="https://newclasses.nyu.edu/">NYU Classes</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The URL to your assignment in the general form of: i6.cims.nyu.edu/~netid/380/</li>
					<li>A compressed archive of your project files (including the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any media resources)</li> 
				</ul>
				<p>Please note that you are required to submit files along with URLs in order to receive credit for your work.</p>
				
				<h4 class="section">Grading</h4>
				<p>This assignment is worth 10 points.</p>
				<ul>
          <li>A new 2D canvas drawing layered behind the foreground (3 points)</li>
          <li>The background layer should occupy the full browser window (1 point)</li>
					<li>A custom 3D geometric object layered in front of the background (3 points)</li>
					<li>Object material (1 point)</li>
					<li>Lighting (1 point)</li>
					<li>Basic animation (1 point)</li>
